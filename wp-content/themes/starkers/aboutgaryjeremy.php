	BRINK is an online media and social networking platform that seeks to feature individuals with uncommon drive and passion, who seek innovative ways to better the world using their talents. With regularly updated articles, photos, videos, podcasts and more, BRINK takes being <i>"on the brink"</i> of success to a whole new level: it serves as a launching pad, feedback forum, and networking tool for the leaders of tomorrow. BRINK combs the United States (starting with Los Angeles and New York) for people just like us with ideas, with projects, with fresh and innovative ways to better the world around them through their desired profession... anyone and everyone who inspires us with their sense of follow-through, ambition, desire, innovation, and forward-thinking mentality. These are the people we'll be hearing about in big publications in two years.
